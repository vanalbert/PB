through application of basic Scientific principles. Wattles teaches 
�Active Power Consciousness� � what is it, why it is necessary to the 
attainment of ANY Goal, and how to develop and use it.&nbsp; What�s 
more, this phenomenal work by Wattles teaches HOW you can readily create
 effective, highly-powerful Active Power Consciousness anytime, for any 
objective, in order to guarantee Success with mathematical precision.</p>
									<p class="regular">By learning to use the events and 
circumstances of today as stepping stones to getting what You want 
tomorrow, and by learning HOW to operate on the Creative Plane, as 
opposed to the Competitive Plane, YOU can learn � TODAY � how to think,

step-by-step Success Manual that teaches you how to leverage virtually 
unknown � but highly proven � Scientific Principles to promote yourself 
and your abilities � professionally, personally or otherwise.&nbsp; 
Whether spurred by personal or professional Desire, learning HOW to 
pursue what we Value and Desire may ultimately determine our level � or 
lack thereof � of Success.</p>
									<p class="regular">Pursuing YOUR Desires and Passions brings 
REAL, HONEST SUCCESS. However, only by learning to �fill� your present 
place � Successfully � and Grow beyond it, will you rise to a Higher 
Level and attain the Success that you Desire.&nbsp; When you do the 
least possible, take shortcuts or give-in to lazy habits, you CANNOT 
outgrow your present circumstance and Success will not be yours.&nbsp; 
In �How to Promote Yourself� you will learn the basic, Universal Laws 
for Advancement, and by practicing and applying those Laws on a day-in, 
day-out basis, YOU will become the Advancing Person and accomplish ALL 
that you truly Desire and seek.</p>

the bargain; it is the feeling of advancement, or increase.�)</li>
										<li>�You must keep in mind what you want to become, and more than fill your present place each day.�</li>
										<li>�The basic element of success in business is, therefore, 
to hold the thought and the mental attitude of advancement; and to more 
than fill your present place. And you more than fill your place by so 
doing your work that those who deal with you are conscious of being 
advanced by you. By study and application of the evolutionary principle,
 success is made a certainty, and failure rendered impossible.�</li>
										<li>The �Law of Opulence� � understanding how this Universal 
Law recognizes only Abundance and Prosperity (and NOT lack or 
limitation) and why working in harmony with the Law of Opulence is 
necessary to escape the lack and limitation of the Competitive Plane.</li>
										<li>How the Competitive Plane is founded on concepts of lack 
and limitation, and therefore, any Success attained through competition 
is never lasting.</li>

										<li>�Transmutation of Competition� � how to move from the Competitive Plane to the Creative Plane.</li>
										<li>How the �Kingdom of God� is available to You, right here, right now � in all of its Prosperity, Abundance and Glory.</li>
										<li>How to avoid Competition and the Competitive Plane when 
most of the business world is based on concepts of competition, lack and
 limitation.</li>
										<li>Man and Money � the concept of Money and the actual role it serves man.</li>
										<li>Why Competition obstructs Your Ability to reap the 
Infiniteness of our Universal Creator (�It will be plainly seen that the
 Divine Mind cannot be brought into action in the field of purely 
competitive business.&nbsp; God cannot be divided against Himself.&nbsp;
 He cannot be made to take from one and give to another.&nbsp; He will 
not decrease one man�s opportunity to advance in life in order to 
increase another man�s opportunity to advance in life.&nbsp; He is no

equally for all, and at the service of all alike.�)</li>
