	<a title="The Science of Being Well" href="/home/item/the-science-of-being-well"><img width="300" height="235" alt="The Science of Being Well" title="The Science of Being Well" src="http://www.prosperitybible.com/images/stories/accimg2.jpg"/></a>
			
	<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You may have heard others say and may have even repeated the metaphor that “your strongest muscle is your mind,” but have you considered what that truly means? In The Science of Being Well, later re-published as How to be a Genius, you will learn how thinking Healthy is the first step to becoming Healthy.</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Learn how the simplest actions we do without thinking, such as breathing, affect our wellbeing; how actions repeated thousands of times, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, can generate powerful and long lasting results.</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Did you know that there is a proper Scientific way to breathe, sleep and eat that actually promotes Health within the body?  Did you know that you can “program” the individual cells in your body – that, among other things, comprise your subconscious mind – in order to attain Health and heal sickness?  Did you know that matters such as “stress,” “anxiety,” “fear,” “worry,” are REALLY states of Mind and symptoms of underlying ill-health?  And, that through proper, Healthy Living, you can overcome these strong negative effects and live a longer, healthier life?  You know, you can!</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our bodies are amazing and continue to perplex doctors and scientists.  Learn how listening to your own body will make you your own best clinician and help you diagnose what ails you and what you truly need.</span></span></p></d
