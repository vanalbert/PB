And, that through proper, Healthy Living, you can overcome these strong negative effects and live a longer, healthier life?  You know, you can!</p>
	<p class="regular">Our bodies are amazing and continue to perplex doctors and scientists.  Learn how listening to your own body will make you your own best clinician and help you diagnose what ails you and what you truly need.</p></d
