	<h1> Jesus: The Man And His Work </h1>
	<a title="Jesus: The Man And His Work" href="/jesus-the-man-and-his-work"><img height="235" width="300" class="inline-left" alt="Jesus: The Man And His Work" title="Jesus: The Man And His Work" src="http://local.prosperitybible.com/sites/all/themes/vanzen/images/accimg14.jpg"/></a>
	<p class="regular">More has been written about Jesus than ANY other individual in the history of the World.  Yet, despite so much information, how well do YOU truly Understand the Teachings of Jesus &mdash; or even the man, himself?</p>
	<p class="regular">In &ldquo;Jesus: The Man and His Work,&rdquo; Mr. Wattles provides an insight into Jesus, His Teachings, and His Work that you surely have never experienced! Using the Gospels of the Bible as his guide, Wattles provides an interpretation that will literally TRANSFORM the way YOU have thought of Jesus and what His Work means to YOUR LIFE!</p>
	<p class="regular">An impressive, commanding intellect, Jesus stood AGAINST the lengthy (and often nonsensical) rituals of the religions of the time and in defense of simple Humanity. And, did you know, that despite His humble birth, and the fact that He owned no real personal property, Jesus actually lived among and associated with some of the Wealthiest, most Prosperous people in His communities? Jesus understood, and taught, that we are meant to live an Abundant, Prosperous and Joyous Life!</p>
	<p class="regular">In this expose by Wattles, you will learn HOW Jesus&lsquo; teachings of equality relate to YOUR Universal Rights to wealth and abundance!  It will change the way YOU Think, Desire and Aspire and provide YOU the Spiritual Confidence to pursue YOUR Desires and Believe &mdash; with FAITH &mdash; that you DESERVE the Good that you Desire!</p>
