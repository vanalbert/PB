	<h1> What Christ Says </h1>
	<a title="What Christ Says" href="/what-christ-says"><img height="235" width="300" alt="What Christ Says" class="inline-left" title="What Christ Says" src="http://www.prosperitybible.com/images/stories/accimg15.jpg"/></a>
	<p class="regular">Who was Christ?  What did He actually teach?  And why is this important to YOU?</p>
	<p class="regular">In “What Christ Says,” learn the REAL, fascinating Truths about Christ: His Personality, His Attitude, His teachings toward Man, and His REAL Teachings about WEALTH – what Christ actually taught about Abundance, Prosperity and Wealth will SHOCK YOU!</p>
	<p class="regular">In truth and fact, Christ was a member of the aristocracy, rubbed shoulders with society’s wealthy and most powerful members – and this translated directly into His teachings on Abundance and Prosperity. Jesus actually taught NOT to worry or be concerned with lack and limitation; rather, the Father provides Wealth for ALL – and in this Life!</p>
	<p class="regular">Learn the SOURCE of Christ’s Miraculous Powers and understand Jesus’ Relationship with God, the Father: a model for EVERYONE.  In “What Christ Says,” Wattles teaches HOW YOU TOO can “Cosmic Consciousness” and develop the “Christ-like Mind.” The Power of Faith and the Process of Receiving – as taught by Jesus for all Mankind to use to Grow and give glory.</p>
	<p class="regular">Wealth is a RIGHT to which we can all appeal and it is Christ-like to Desire a Rich, Full, Abundant, Prosperous, Healthy and Wealthy LIFE.</p>
	<a title="What Christ Says" href="/home/item/what-christ-says"><img height="100" width="700" alt="What Christ Says" title="What Christ Says" src="http://www.prosperitybible.com/images/stories/divider.png"/></a>
	<ul class="tick">
		<li>His Personality – why the common concept of Christ is distorted and inaccurate.  Learn of Christ’s true human nature and His Power of God Consciousness.</li>
		<li>The REAL Jesus – while not personally owning property, Jesus was a member of the aristocratic society and understood Abundance and Prosperity.</li>
		<li>The REAL Jesus was educated and a learned Man.</li>
		<li>Jesus had many influential and wealthy friends and knew NO lack of anything.  Lazarus, Jesus’ dear friend, Lazarus’ sisters, Joseph of Arimethea, Nicodemus – all were of Wealth and provided plenty for Jesus.</li>
		<li>Jesus was not “humble” – in the commonly accepted meaning of that word; rather, Jesus was of strong personality, assertive, commanding, and of Power.  He “spoke as one having authority” and “his word was with power.”</li>
		<li>To be like the Christ of the four Gospels, one must be learned, well dressed, well supplied with money, and of noble and commanding appearance, speaking with authority, and having tremendous magnetic power.</li>
		<li>His Attitude – He declared His fealty to humanity by proclaiming “I am a son of Man.”</li>
		<li>The World Jesus Lived In – full of extortion, corruption and oppression at every level.</li>
		<li>The Sects of Jesus’ Day – even among the Jewish people, there was tremendous disagreement, and innumerable rules to follow.</li>
		<li>The New Thought of Jesus’ Time: Into this maze of oppression, taxation, murder, outrage and theological discussion comes the grand, strong figure of this young prince and scholar, saying; “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach good news to the poor.  I am no Pharisee; I am no Sadducee, Essene, or Samaritan; I am a man.  I come, not in behalf of Pharisaism or Samaritanism, but in behalf of humanity.”</li>
		<li>Why Jesus was vested with Authority to pass judgment and what this means to You today.</li>
		<li>Jesus’ Teachings About Man – “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.”</li>
		<li>All men are equal in the eyes of God; to be little any man as being inferior is to condemn yourself.  The Truths, the Universal Laws, all command that we love each other.</li>
		<li>Understand Jesus’ true teachings on the Sabbath, Organizations, Little Children.</li>
		<li>Jesus’ Teachings About WEALTH – What Jesus actually taught about the attainment of Wealth will SHOCK You!</li>
		<li>“Seek the kind of kingdom your Father wants; a perfectly righteous order of things, and you will have plenty of everything.”</li>
		<li>Jesus actually taught not to worry or be concerned with lack and limitation; rather, the Father provides Wealth for ALL – and in this Life.</li>
		<li>“The Kingdom of God” – what Jesus really meant and why the Kingdom is available to You here and now.</li>
		<li>Jesus’ Teachings on Equality and Democracy – Revolutionary at that time and literally hundreds and hundreds of years before those teachings would slowly be embraced.</li>
		<li>The Golden Rule: “Love Thy Neighbor.”  Why You MUST follow this mandate in order to reap Prosperity and Abundance in this Life.</li>
		<li>Why the Apostles so misunderstood the Teachings of Jesus at that time,</li>
		<li>The Source of Power – Learn the Source of Jesus’ “miraculous” Powers and how those same Powers are made available to everyone from Supreme Intelligence, God the Father.</li>
		<li>“The Unity of Man in God” – what it means and why it is important to attaining Your Desires.</li>
		<li>“Cosmic Consciousness” – uniting Your Consciousness with Universal Consciousness.</li>
		<li>Jesus’ Relationship with God, the Father: a model for EVERYONE.</li>
		<li>Attaining Cosmic Consciousness – “And this is Life Eternal: to know God.”</li>
		<li>Prayer: The extension of Consciousness through Mental Effort to unite with Divine Consciousness.</li>
		<li>Prayer – as Jesus taught us to pray!</li>
		<li>Knowing the Will of the Father so as to unite Your Will for the attainment of the Good that You Desire and Deserve.</li>
		<li>The Power of Faith and the Process of Receiving – as taught by Jesus for all Mankind to use to Grow and give glory.</li>

		<li>“The Mind of Christ” – what it means – to YOU.</li>
		<li>Demonstration and Attainment – Attaining a Life of Abundance through Christ.</li>
		<li>Demonstration and Attainment of Health Consciousness, Power Consciousness, Wisdom Consciousness, and Wealth Consciousness.</li>
