	<h1> How To Promote Yourself </h1>
	<a title="How To Promote Yourself" href="/home/item/how-to-promote-yourself"><img height="235" width="300" alt="How To Promote Yourself" class="inline-left" title="How To Promote Yourself" src="http://local.prosperitybible.com/sites/all/themes/vanzen/images/stories/accimg10.jpg"/></a>
	<p class="regular">“How to Promote Yourself” is just that – a step-by-step Success Manual that teaches you how to leverage virtually unknown – but highly proven – Scientific Principles to promote yourself and your abilities – professionally, personally or otherwise.  Whether spurred by personal or professional Desire, learning HOW to pursue what we Value and Desire may ultimately determine our level – or lack thereof – of Success.</p>
	<p class="regular">Pursuing YOUR Desires and Passions brings REAL, HONEST SUCCESS. However, only by learning to “fill” your present place – Successfully – and Grow beyond it, will you rise to a Higher Level and attain the Success that you Desire.  When you do the least possible, take shortcuts or give-in to lazy habits, you CANNOT outgrow your present circumstance and Success will not be yours.  In “How to Promote Yourself” you will learn the basic, Universal Laws for Advancement, and by practicing and applying those Laws on a day-in, day-out basis, YOU will become the Advancing Person and accomplish ALL that you truly Desire and seek.</p>
	<p class="regular">Learn to avoid the notions of lack and limitation inherent in working on the Competitive Plane and learn HOW to implement the positive notions of Abundance and Prosperity inherent in the Creative Plane by using YOUR God-given Creative Faculties to achieve the Success that you Desire and Deserve – by learning Wattles’ Scientific Methodology of “How to Promote Yourself.”</p>

	<ul class="tick">
		<li>The Power of the “Business Attitude” – what it is and how to use it to Succeed.</li>
		<li>Understanding “Desire” – the powerful force that drives one to Succeed.</li>
		<li>How to increase the intensity of Your Desire and why it is important to Your Success.</li>
		<li>How to become what YOU want to be and why pursuing Your Desires and Passions bring real, honest Success.</li>
		<li>How to use Your Intellectual Faculties on a higher plane in order to achieve Wealth and attain the Success You Desire and Deserve.</li>

		<li>Why You must “fill” Your present place in order to advance to a higher place.</li>
		<li>Why doing more than is required of You is the best method of promoting Yourself in any endeavor – and why doing more to gain favors or “for show” ultimately fails Your efforts to advance Yourself.</li>
		<li>Why waiting for an Opportunity to be “all that you want to be” stifles Growth and Advancement.</li>
		<li>Learn to see and take advantage of the numerous Opportunities that present themselves every day.</li>
		<li>“There is no such thing as lack of opportunities for the man who is living the advancing life, and who has an advancing mind. Everything that touches your life is an opportunity, if you discover its proper use.”</li>
		<li>“Advancing Thought” – what it is and how to use it every day to promote Yourself and attain greater Success.</li>
		<li>How to use “Advancing Thought” in every matter and transaction to generate even greater transactions.</li>
		<li>How to place the Thought of Advance with very customer or person with whom you conduct business to generate continued and repeat business. (“It is not the quantity or quality of the goods that makes the bargain; it is the feeling of advancement, or increase.”)</li>
		<li>“You must keep in mind what you want to become, and more than fill your present place each day.”</li>

		<li>“The basic element of success in business is, therefore, to hold the thought and the mental attitude of advancement; and to more than fill your present place. And you more than fill your place by so doing your work that those who deal with you are conscious of being advanced by you. By study and application of the evolutionary principle, success is made a certainty, and failure rendered impossible.”</li>
		<li>The “Law of Opulence” – understanding how this Universal Law recognizes only Abundance and Prosperity (and NOT lack or limitation) and why working in harmony with the Law of Opulence is necessary to escape the lack and limitation of the Competitive Plane.</li>
		<li>How the Competitive Plane is founded on concepts of lack and limitation, and therefore, any Success attained through competition is never lasting.</li>
		<li>“Transmutation of Competition” – how to move from the Competitive Plane to the Creative Plane.</li>
		<li>How the “Kingdom of God” is available to You, right here, right now – in all of its Prosperity, Abundance and Glory.</li>
		<li>How to avoid Competition and the Competitive Plane when most of the business world is based on concepts of competition, lack and limitation.</li>
		<li>Man and Money – the concept of Money and the actual role it serves man.</li>
		<li>Why Competition obstructs Your Ability to reap the Infiniteness of our Universal Creator (“It will be plainly seen that the Divine Mind cannot be brought into action in the field of purely competitive business.  God cannot be divided against Himself.  He cannot be made to take from one and give to another.  He will not decrease one man’s opportunity to advance in life in order to increase another man’s opportunity to advance in life.  He is no respecter of persons, and has no favorites.  He is equally in all, equally for all, and at the service of all alike.”)</li>
		<li>Why Desiring for all what You Desire for Yourself is a Powerful method for attaining Success.</li>

		<li>Talk that builds Success – right and wrong speech in Your quest to Succeed and attain Prosperity.</li>
		<li>“Poverty Talk” – what is it and why it MUST be avoided at all costs in order to attain Prosperity and Wealth.</li>
		<li>Why (and how) poverty is bred by 1) the ignorant, 2) the lazy, and 3) the incompetent (as harsh as that seems!).</li>
		<li>Understanding “Wealth Talk” and how to use it to gain Wealth.</li>
