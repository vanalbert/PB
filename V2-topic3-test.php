	<p class="regular">As Infinite as the Universe, so too is our Consciousness and the Powers and Abilities of our Mind. In What Is Truth? learn HOW these Universal Truths translate into Infinite possibilities for YOU, and, consequently, for what YOU hold to be possible for YOUR Life &mdash; Spiritually, Emotionally, Intellectually, and Financially.</p>
	<p class="regular">YOU were created in the likeness and image of God with the inherent ability to co-create YOUR Life! As a Spiritual Being, with an Intelligent Mind and Powerful Conscious Ability, does this not also suggest that God provide YOU with an INFINITE CREATIVE POWER?  Learning to tap into this Self-Supremacy will not only bring YOU closer to our Supreme Intelligence and Creator, but will you to access YOUR God-given abilities to be, do and have more &mdash; to attain the Life that YOU Desire!</p>
