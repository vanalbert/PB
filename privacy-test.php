									<p><strong>4. </strong><strong><span class="uline">The Type of Information We Collect From You</span></strong></p>
									<p>As with most of the Internet, visiting the Site will automatically tell us certain information about you, such basic information comprising (but not necessarily limited to), your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website, your computer’s operating system, and the type of web browser that you are using. &nbsp;Our Site automatically records this basic information.</p>
									<p>In addition, with most of the Internet, the Site may use “cookies,” simple information in the form of a file, usually a text file, which the Site’s server transfers to your computer. &nbsp;This information can be used to track your session on the Site, your preferences, when you return and other related information. &nbsp;Cookies may also be used to customize the Site Content for you as an individual. &nbsp;If you use any one of the common Internet web browsers, such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, FireFox or Apple’s Safari, you can set up your browser to either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.</p>
									<p><strong>Princeton Cambridge Publishing Group</strong> may also collect any data that you provide by posting it at or on the Site or by e-mail.&nbsp; You can always choose not to provide us with information. However, if you do withhold information, you may be denied access or use to some or all of the Site’s functions, services and/or features.</p>

									<p>Some transactions between you and the Site may involve payment by credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment services. &nbsp;In such transactions, we will collect information related to the transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, including your billing address, telephone number, and other information related to the transaction.</p>
									<p><strong>5. </strong><strong><span class="uline">What We Do with Your Information</span></strong></p>
									<p>We use your information to operate the Site’s business activities.&nbsp; For example, we may use this data to contact you about changes to the Site, new services or features offered by the Site or special offers offered by <strong>Princeton Cambridge Publishing Group</strong>, or the data may be used by <strong>Princeton Cambridge Publishing Group </strong>to resolve disputes, troubleshoot issues, and enforce the Site’s <a target="_blank" href="/terms-and-conditions-of-use" title="The Prosperity Bible web site Terms and Conditions of Use - Princeton Cambridge Publishing Group, LLC Terms and Conditions of Use"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.</p>
									<p>Generally, it is our policy that The Success Manual will not provide any Personal Information to third parties without your permission (the “<strong>General Policy of Disclosure</strong>”). &nbsp;However, there are some <strong>important exceptions</strong> to the General Policy of Disclosure that are described in the following paragraphs (the “<strong>Exceptions</strong>”):</p>


									<ul>
										<li><strong>A</strong>.&nbsp; We may, in our sole discretion, provide Personal Information to law enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud investigations, alleged intellectual property infringement, or any other suspected illegal activity or mailers that may expose us to legal liability.</li>
										<li><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;Although we do not disclose individually identifiable information, we may disclose aggregate data about the Site’s visitors to advertisers or other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.</li>
										<li><strong>C</strong>.&nbsp;From time to time, we may use third party suppliers to provide services on the Site (“<strong>Third Party Providers</strong>”).&nbsp; In such cases and circumstances, if a Third Party Provider wants to collect Personal Information, you will be appropriately notified before any Personal Information is collected by a Third Party Provider. &nbsp;You will never be required to provide Personal Information to a Third Party Provider and <strong>Princeton Cambridge Publishing Group</strong> restricts the method and manner in which Third Party Providers may use Personal Information in the event that you voluntarily choose to provide Personal Information to Third Party Providers.&nbsp; <strong>In each and every case, under NO circumstances, is a Third Part Provider allowed to sell, give or otherwise transfer ANY Personal Information to others.</strong></li>
									</ul>

									<p><strong>7. </strong><strong><span class="uline">Your Use of Information and Unsolicited Junk E-Mail</span></strong></p>

									<p>You may choose, at your sole and exclusive discretion, to provide Personal Information to Site visitors or other third parties who are not the Site’s Third Party Providers.&nbsp; We strongly urge you to use caution when doing so, as this Privacy Policy does NOT apply to such situations where you decide to disclose your Personal Information. &nbsp;The privacy policies and customs of these third parties will determine how any disclosed Personal Information is used by those parties.</p>
