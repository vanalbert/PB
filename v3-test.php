									<p class="regular">Pursuing YOUR Desires and Passions brings REAL, HONEST SUCCESS. However, only by learning to &ldquo;fill&rdquo; your present place &mdash; Successfully &mdash; and Grow beyond it, will you rise to a Higher Level and attain the Success that you Desire.&nbsp; When you do the least possible, take shortcuts or give-in to lazy habits, you CANNOT outgrow your present circumstance and Success will not be yours.&nbsp; In &ldquo;How to Promote Yourself&rdquo; you will learn the basic, Universal Laws for Advancement, and by practicing and applying those Laws on a day-in, day-out basis, YOU will become the Advancing Person and accomplish ALL that you truly Desire and seek.</p>

										<li>&ldquo;The basic element of success in business is, therefore, to hold the thought and the mental attitude of advancement; and to more than fill your present place.

										<li>How to avoid Competition and the Competitive Plane when most of the business world is based on concepts of competition, lack and limitation.</li>
										<li>Man and Money &mdash; the concept of Money and the actual role it serves man.</li>
										<li>Why Competition obstructs Your Ability to reap the Infiniteness of our Universal Creator (&ldquo;It will be plainly seen that the Divine Mind cannot be brought into action in the field of purely competitive business.&nbsp; God cannot be divided against Himself.&nbsp; He cannot be made to take from one and give to another.&nbsp; He will not decrease one man&rsquo;s opportunity to advance in life in order to increase another man&rsquo;s opportunity to advance in life.&nbsp; He is no respecter of persons, and has no favorites.&nbsp; He is equally in all, equally for all, and at the service of all alike.&rdquo;)</li>
