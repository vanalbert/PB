										<li>An in-depth accounting and interpretation of Jesus and His work directly from the Bible that you will not find in any where else.</li>
										<li>Why your perception of Jesus is likely distorted and based on erroneous teachings.</li>
										<li>Jesus was a Strong Man, the Supreme Man of the Highest Type.</li>
										<li>Contrary to many beliefs, Jesus had an incredibly brilliant Mind and was friends with may aristocrats and wealthy people.</li>
										<li>Jesus had an impressive, commanding, powerful personal appearance.</li>
										<li>Jesus came for and stood for Humanity, and stood against vested religions at that time.</li>
										<li>Why Jesus bonded with and related so well to children and why a “child like Mind” is essential for Spiritual Growth.&nbsp; (“Jesus took a little child and set him in the midst of them, and said: “Whosoever shall offend one of these little ones it is better that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and he were cast into the sea.”)</li>

									<p class="regular">Who was Christ?&nbsp; What did He actually teach?&nbsp; And why is this important to YOU?</p>
									<p class="regular">In “What Christ Says,” learn the REAL, fascinating Truths about Christ: His Personality, His Attitude, His teachings toward Man, and His REAL Teachings about WEALTH – what Christ actually taught about Abundance, Prosperity and Wealth will SHOCK YOU!</p>
									<p class="regular">In truth and fact, Christ was a member of the aristocracy, rubbed shoulders with society’s wealthy and most powerful members – and this translated directly into His teachings on Abundance and Prosperity. Jesus actually taught NOT to worry or be concerned with lack and limitation; rather, the Father provides Wealth for ALL – and in this Life!</p>
									<p class="regular">Learn the SOURCE of Christ’s Miraculous Powers and understand Jesus’ Relationship with God, the Father: a model for EVERYONE.&nbsp; In “What Christ Says,” Wattles teaches HOW YOU TOO can “Cosmic Consciousness” and develop the “Christ-like Mind.” The Power of Faith and the Process of Receiving – as taught by Jesus for all Mankind to use to Grow and give glory.</p>

										<li>The REAL Jesus was educated and a learned Man.</li>
										<li>Jesus had many influential and wealthy friends and knew NO lack of anything.&nbsp; Lazarus, Jesus’ dear friend, Lazarus’ sisters, Joseph of Arimethea, Nicodemus – all were of Wealth and provided plenty for Jesus.</li>
										<li>Jesus was not “humble” – in the commonly accepted meaning of that word; rather, Jesus was of strong personality, assertive, commanding, and of Power.&nbsp; He “spoke as one having authority” and “his word was with power.”</li>
										<li>To be like the Christ of the four Gospels, one must be learned, well dressed, well supplied with money, and of noble and commanding appearance, speaking with authority, and having tremendous magnetic power.</li>
										<li>His Attitude – He declared His fealty to humanity by proclaiming “I am a son of Man.”</li>
										<li>The World Jesus Lived In – full of extortion, corruption and oppression at every level.</li>
										<li>The Sects of Jesus’ Day – even among the Jewish people, there was tremendous disagreement, and innumerable rules to follow.</li>
										<li>The New Thought of Jesus’ Time: Into this maze of oppression, taxation, murder, outrage and theological discussion comes the grand, strong figure of this young prince and scholar, saying; “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach good news to the poor.&nbsp; I am no Pharisee; I am no Sadducee, Essene, or Samaritan; I am a man.&nbsp; I come, not in behalf of Pharisaism or Samaritanism, but in behalf of humanity.”</li>
										<li>Why Jesus was vested with Authority to pass judgment and what this means to You today.</li>
										<li>Jesus’ Teachings About Man – “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.”</li>
										<li>All men are equal in the eyes of God; to be little any man as being inferior is to condemn yourself.&nbsp; The Truths, the Universal Laws, all command that we love each other.</li>
										<li>Understand Jesus’ true teachings on the Sabbath, Organizations, Little Children.</li>

										<li>“The Kingdom of God” – what Jesus really meant and why the Kingdom is available to You here and now.</li>
										<li>Jesus’ Teachings on Equality and Democracy – Revolutionary at that time and literally hundreds and hundreds of years before those teachings would slowly be embraced.</li>
										<li>The Golden Rule: “Love Thy Neighbor.”&nbsp; Why You MUST follow this mandate in order to reap Prosperity and Abundance in this Life.</li>
										<li>Why the Apostles so misunderstood the Teachings of Jesus at that time,</li>
										<li>The Source of Power – Learn the Source of Jesus’ “miraculous” Powers and how those same Powers are made available to everyone from Supreme Intelligence, God the Father.</li>
										<li>“The Unity of Man in God” – what it means and why it is important to attaining Your Desires.</li>
										<li>“Cosmic Consciousness” – uniting Your Consciousness with Universal Consciousness.</li>
										<li>Jesus’ Relationship with God, the Father: a model for EVERYONE.</li>

										<li>Knowing the Will of the Father so as to unite Your Will for the attainment of the Good that You Desire and Deserve.</li>
