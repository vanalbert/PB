									<p class="regular">The Law of Attraction teaches us that, as a first step, we must positively will what we Desire so as to set in motion the Universal Forces that will attract our Desire to us. This is often accomplished by taking the first practical step of surrounding ourselves with the right people – those people in harmony with what it is that we Desire. In this series of articles by Mr. Wattles, you will learn how to use your Mind to present yourself in the proper and necessary role as a leader so that you may attract others who seek the leadership you possess.&nbsp; Think about it: if wealth is what you Desire, you would much rather want to attract to you wealthy people than those who live in poverty.</p>
									<p class="regular">Our habits, conditioning and paradigms determine how we live our lives from day-to-day; but, what we fail to realize is that HOW we spend our days, leads to HOW we spend our weeks, months and years. Thus, by CHANGING our habits, conditioning and paradigms of how we view our world, we have the God-given Power and Ability to CHANGE Our World! We were given an infinitely POWERFUL Mind – as standard operating equipment at birth – and we can use it – TODAY – to alter our conditioning, eliminate bad habits, and change our paradigms and spend more of our energy on what leads us TOWARDS what it is that we Desire, rather than away from it.</p>
									<p class="regular">We engage in various mental activities virtually non-stop – from true conscious deep thinking to mindless daydreaming.. Now imagine the incredible Power of aligning your mental activities towards purposeful, directed and focused thinking – all directed towards a specific objective, With these teachings, You will learn to do just that and leverage the Infinite Power of YOUR Mind.</p>

									<img src="http://local.prosperitybible.com/sites/all/themes/vanzen/images/vol-2-3-img.jpg" class="inline-left" title="Lessons In Constructive Science" alt="Lessons In Constructive Science" height="235" width="300" />
									<p class="regular">God wants us all to Live an Abundant, Prosperous and Wealthy life - whether financial or otherwise. It is Nature’s intent that ALL things – and most particularly, human life – GROW.  The purpose of Nature is the advancement and unfoldment of life and Desire is possibility seeking expression, or function seeking performance.</p>
									<p class="regular">In this series of fifteen Lessons, you will learn to distinguish between merely wanting (wishing) and Willing (Desiring) in order to focus your mental, emotional and spiritual being to be receptive to only that which you truly Desire through use and application of proven Constructive Science methods.</p>
									<p class="regular">“As a man thinketh in his heart, so shall he be.”  Under the Laws of the Universe, we inherently attract what we think. When we think negatively, we focus upon that which we don’t want, thereby attracting the very thing that we FEAR and NOT what we want; likewise, when we think positively, and focus upon our true Desires, we thereby attract that which we seek.  In Lessons in Constructive Science, you will learn HOW maximize your positive Mental Attitude to cultivate and exploit YOUR God-given abilities and transform YOUR thought processes into real, tangible RESULTS.</p>
									<p class="regular">Learning to distinguish between Constructive and Destructive Mental Attitudes will change the way YOU think.  Changing the WAY YOU THINK will change the RESULTS in YOUR Life.</p>
