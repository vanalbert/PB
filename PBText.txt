<p>This is a wonderful compilation and an in depth inquiry of Mind by the Law of Attraction guru&nbsp;Wattles D Wattles.&nbsp; It broadens the horizons of mind by letting us know that there is a force that is greater than Mind which operates the mind.&nbsp; My favorite quote is "While there appears to be life without intelligence, there is nowhere any intelligence without life." Thank you so much for this valuable information.</p>

In The Science of Being Well, later re-published as How to be a Genius, you will learn how thinking Healthy is the first step to becoming Healthy.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Learn how the simplest actions we do without thinking, such as breathing, affect our wellbeing; how actions repeated thousands of times, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, can generate powerful and long lasting results.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Did you know that there is a proper Scientific way to breathe, sleep and eat that actually promotes Health within the body?&nbsp; Did you know that you can “program” the individual cells in your body – that, among other things, comprise your subconscious mind – in order to attain Health and heal sickness?&nbsp; Did you know that matters such as “stress,” “anxiety,” “fear,” “worry,” are REALLY states of Mind and symptoms of underlying ill-health?&nbsp; And, that through proper, Healthy Living, you can overcome these strong negative effects and live a longer, healthier life?&nbsp; You know, you can!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our bodies are amazing and continue to perplex doctors and scientists.&nbsp; Learn how listening to your own body will make you your own best clinician and help you diagnose what ails you and what you truly need.</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We are impatient creatures and lack of patience leads to many of life’s failures.&nbsp; In The Science of Being Great, you will learn how rushing towards ANY goal can be FATAL to Success.&nbsp; Yes, taking Massive Action – when Action is required – is key to attaining Success on any level; but learning when and where to apply patience is not only virtuous and rewarding, it builds Character, develops Leadership and is Empowering! Life is a process that cannot be hurried and learning to appreciate this simple truth yields results far faster than we might otherwise expect.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As with most things in life, it is preparation and planning that produces the outcomes that we admire – whether they be in relationships or other personal matters, corporate achievements or political success stories. The same is true of ourselves and by learning and APPLYING the Scientific Methods of Being Great , you can – and SHALL – achieve Extraordinary Greatness – in YOUR LIFE!</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

This is often accomplished by taking the first practical step of surrounding ourselves with the right people – those people in harmony with what it is that we Desire. In this series of articles by Mr. Wattles, you will learn how to use your Mind to present yourself in the proper and necessary role as a leader so that you may attract others who seek the leadership you possess.&nbsp; Think about it: if wealth is what you Desire, you would much rather want to attract to you wealthy people than those who live in poverty.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our habits, conditioning and paradigms determine how we live our lives from day-to-day; but, what we fail to realize is that HOW we spend our days, leads to HOW we spend our weeks, months and years. Thus, by CHANGING our habits, conditioning and paradigms of how we view our world, we have the God-given Power and Ability to CHANGE Our World! We were given an infinitely POWERFUL Mind – as standard operating equipment at birth – and we can use it – TODAY – to alter our conditioning, eliminate bad habits, and change our paradigms and spend more of our energy on what leads us TOWARDS what it is that we Desire, rather than away from it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We engage in various mental activities virtually non-stop – from true conscious deep thinking to mindless daydreaming.. Now imagine the incredible Power of aligning your mental activities towards purposeful, directed and focused thinking – all directed towards a specific objective, With these teachings, You will learn to do just that and leverage the Infinite Power of YOUR Mind.</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

It is Nature’s intent that ALL things – and most particularly, human life – GROW.&nbsp; The purpose of Nature is the advancement and unfoldment of life and Desire is possibility seeking expression, or function seeking performance.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In this series of fifteen Lessons, you will learn to distinguish between merely wanting (wishing) and Willing (Desiring) in order to focus your mental, emotional and spiritual being to be receptive to only that which you truly Desire through use and application of proven Constructive Science methods.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“As a man thinketh in his heart, so shall he be.”&nbsp; Under the Laws of the Universe, we inherently attract what we think. When we think negatively, we focus upon that which we don’t want, thereby attracting the very thing that we FEAR and NOT what we want; likewise, when we think positively, and focus upon our true Desires, we thereby attract that which we seek.&nbsp; In Lessons in Constructive Science, you will learn HOW maximize your positive Mental Attitude to cultivate and exploit YOUR God-given abilities and transform YOUR thought processes into real, tangible RESULTS.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Learning to distinguish between Constructive and Destructive Mental Attitudes will change the way YOU think.&nbsp; Changing the WAY YOU THINK will change the RESULTS in YOUR Life..</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In this short, but highly empowering manual, Wattles teaches in exacting detail the Law of Cause and Effect – called “the Law of Laws” by Emerson.&nbsp; Success is an Effect; Learn, understand and apply the Cause, and YOU too will achieve profound Success!</span></span></p>

Wattles teaches “Active Power Consciousness” – what is it, why it is necessary to the attainment of ANY Goal, and how to develop and use it.&nbsp; What’s more, this phenomenal work by Wattles teaches HOW you can readily create effective, highly-powerful Active Power Consciousness anytime, for any objective, in order to guarantee Success with mathematical precision.</span></span></p>

More food does not lead to more energy; many already understand this to be true. Why, then, do so many struggle with weight loss and maintaining healthy eating habits?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In “Health Through New Thought and Fasting,” Wattles teaches his Scientific, step-by-step method for proper Nutrition, Sleep and Living Habits – in conjunction with Constructive Thought, Speech and Action – to attain a rigorous, balanced and HEALTHY Life! Learn to distinguish between “hunger” – your body’s TRUE need for fuel – and “appetite” – your conditioned, habit patterns to eat when it is not necessary! Learn HOW to use YOUR Mind to facilitate and increase efficiency in eating, digestion and assimilation of Food.&nbsp; And, by learning and practicing proper Sleep methods, you will develop the POWER of renewing, re-energizing and revitalizing YOUR Subconscious Mind, thereby realizing NEW sources of energy to POWER YOUR LIFE!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using the Scientific Methods of “Health Through New Thought and Fasting,” YOU can learn HOW to MASTER YOUR HEALTH!&nbsp; As the old adage says, “He who has his health, has everything!”</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There is a Scientific Method to Marriage, and in “Scientific Marriage,” Master Wattles explains how to apply Scientific Principles to the Marital Relationship.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Understanding that it is nature’s will that reproduce, it is critically important to understand the relationship between sex and love and its impact on human relationships. Further, learning to differentiate between the different “kinds” of marriage (the various underlying reasons as to WHY we marry), can help avoid a marriage doomed from the start or even turn a marriage that is headed in the wrong direction.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Mind is our most POWERFUL God-given tool.&nbsp; By using it Scientifically in all aspects of our Lives – including Marriage – YOU can achieve a richer, more fulfilling and ABUNDANT LIFE!</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In “Jesus: The Man and His Work,” Mr. Wattles provides an insight into Jesus, His Teachings, and His Work that you surely have never experienced! Using the Gospels of the Bible as his guide, Wattles provides an interpretation that will literally TRANSFORM the way YOU have thought of Jesus and what His Work means to YOUR LIFE!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">An impressive, commanding intellect, Jesus stood AGAINST the lengthy (and often nonsensical) rituals of the religions of the time and in defense of simple Humanity. And, did you know, that despite His humble birth, and the fact that He owned no real personal property, Jesus actually lived among and associated with some of the Wealthiest, most Prosperous people in His communities? Jesus understood, and taught, that we are meant to live an Abundant, Prosperous and Joyous Life!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In this expose by Wattles, you will learn HOW Jesus’ teachings of equality relate to YOUR Universal Rights to wealth and abundance!&nbsp; It will change the way YOU Think, Desire and Aspire and provide YOU the Spiritual Confidence to pursue YOUR Desires and Believe – with FAITH – that you DESERVE the Good that you Desire!</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In truth and fact, Christ was a member of the aristocracy, rubbed shoulders with society’s wealthy and most powerful members – and this translated directly into His teachings on Abundance and Prosperity. Jesus actually taught NOT to worry or be concerned with lack and limitation; rather, the Father provides Wealth for ALL – and in this Life!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Learn the SOURCE of Christ’s Miraculous Powers and understand Jesus’ Relationship with God, the Father: a model for EVERYONE.&nbsp; In “What Christ Says,” Wattles teaches HOW YOU TOO can “Cosmic Consciousness” and develop the “Christ-like Mind.” The Power of Faith and the Process of Receiving – as taught by Jesus for all Mankind to use to Grow and give glory.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wealth is a RIGHT to which we can all appeal and it is Christ-like to Desire a Rich, Full, Abundant, Prosperous, Healthy and Wealthy LIFE.</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The title, “As a Grain of Mustard Seed,” is from a teaching by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.&nbsp; In response to questions by His disciples as to why they could not heal a sick boy, Jesus responds, “Because of your little faith . . . if you have FAITH the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move.&nbsp; NOTHING will be impossible for you.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">And, there, is the Lesson of “Mustard Seed” in all of its simplicity: With Faith, anything is possible and nothing is impossible!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: book antiqua,palatino;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“As A Grain of Mustard Seed” was Wattles’ final work.&nbsp; He died before the final two chapters were published.</span></span></p></div></div>	</div>

<p>This is a wonderful compilation and an in depth inquiry of Mind by the Law of Attraction guru&nbsp;Wattles D Wattles.&nbsp; It broadens the horizons of mind by letting us know that there is a force that is greater than Mind which operates the mind.&nbsp; My favorite quote is "While there appears to be life without intelligence, there is nowhere any intelligence without life." Thank you so much for this valuable information.</p>
