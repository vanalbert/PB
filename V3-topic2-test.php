	<a title="How To Get What You Want" href="/the-powerful-life-copy"><img height="235" width="300" class="inline-left" alt="How To Get What You Want" title="How To Get What You Want" src="http://local.prosperitybible.com/sites/all/themes/vanzen/images/accimg9.jpg"/></a>
	<p class="regular">Out of all of Wattles&lsquo; works, there may be no other book with a title as emotionally charging as &ldquo;How to Get What You Want.:  The name says it all!</p>
	<p class="regular">In this short, but highly empowering manual, Wattles teaches in exacting detail the Law of Cause and Effect &mdash; called &ldquo;the Law of Laws&rdquo; by Emerson.  Success is an Effect; Learn, understand and apply the Cause, and YOU too will achieve profound Success!</p>
	<p class="regular">In &ldquo;How to Get What You Want,&rdquo; you will learn how to methodically attain Success with mathematical certainty through application of basic Scientific principles. Wattles teaches &ldquo;Active Power Consciousness&rdquo; &mdash; what is it, why it is necessary to the attainment of ANY Goal, and how to develop and use it.  What&lsquo;s more, this phenomenal work by Wattles teaches HOW you can readily create effective, highly-powerful Active Power Consciousness anytime, for any objective, in order to guarantee Success with mathematical precision.</p>
	<p class="regular">By learning to use the events and circumstances of today as stepping stones to getting what You want tomorrow, and by learning HOW to operate on the Creative Plane, as opposed to the Competitive Plane, YOU can learn &mdash; TODAY &mdash; how to think, believe and act to create the tomorrow you could only otherwise imagine.</p>

		<li>Learn how to methodically attain Success with mathematical certainty through application of basic scientific principles.</li>
		<li>Why the development of Your Special Faculties in Your line of work, business or profession is essential to proper application of scientific Success Principles and how to develop those Faculties with precision.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Active Power Consciousness&rdquo; &mdash; what is it, why it is necessary to the attainment of ANY Goal, and how to develop and use it.</li>

		<li>Power-Consciousness is what you feel when you know that you can do a thing; and you know HOW to do the thing. &ldquo;Active Power Consciousness&rdquo; is Power-Consciousness in ACTION.</li>

		<li>Learn how to develop &ldquo;True Belief,&rdquo; a critically essential step to creating Active Power Consciousness.</li>
		<li>Powerful Autosuggestions for You to practice in order to learn how to create Active Power Consciousness.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Constructive Action&rdquo; &mdash; what it is, why it is different from ordinary Action, and how to effectively use it with Active Power Consciousness to attain Success in ANY endeavor.</li>
		<li>How Nature uses Constructive Action in the evolution process to develop stronger, better and more efficient life forms.</li>
		<li>Nature&lsquo;s &ldquo;Perfection Principle&rdquo; &mdash; what most individuals don&lsquo;t understand and why they continue to fail time and time again (The &ldquo;Perfection Principle&rdquo; states that &ldquo;Every person who does one thing perfect is instantly presented with an opportunity to begin doing the next larger thing.&rdquo;  Since the vast majority of people fail to perfect the most basic of skills and tasks, they are not instantly presented with the rightful Opportunity to advance into Greatness).</li>
		<li>Why Success in Your present business or professional position is CRUCIAL to Your Success in your IDEAL business or professional position.</li>
		<li>Why You MUST master and perfect every task, no matter how menial or trivial, if You are to master Success at significant levels.</li>

		<li>Learn to use the events and circumstances of today as stepping stones to getting what You want tomorrow.</li>
		<li>How to add more Life to every relationship, thereby building better, more sincere relationships &mdash; especially with the people around You and whom you love.</li>
		<li>How to have the very best today, knowing that what You really Desire and Deserve can be had tomorrow.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Impression of Increase&rdquo; &mdash; the art and scientific method of Visualizing Your Desires into physical reality.</li>
		<li>Why having a very clear picture of what You want is key to attaining Your Desires.</li>
		<li>The &ldquo;Competitive Plane&rdquo; vs. the &ldquo;Creative Plane&rdquo; &mdash; why Competitive Consciousness will block Your Abilities to Succeed and attain Wealth &mdash; every time!</li>
		<li>Why it is absolutely critical that You make EVERY act a Successful act &mdash; regardless of how small or trivial it may seem.  (Success is attained by doing every small act Successfully, every day)</li>
