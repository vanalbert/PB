<p class="regular">We learn from early childhood that exercise is important for our health and wellbeing, but why do so few realize that the same is true for our mind?  Why do only a few people achieve Greatness in their lives, while the majority of the masses live in mediocrity?  Why are even fewer individuals &ldquo;born to Lead,&rdquo; while even greater numbers of the masses resign to living a life of &ldquo;following?&rdquo; In The Science of Being Great, Later re-published as How to be a Genius, learn the very steps that lead toward Greatness and Power &mdash; and HOW you can implement and practice these Scientific Truths to achieve Greatness and Power &mdash; in YOUR life.</p>
<p class="regular">We are impatient creatures and lack of patience leads to many of life&lsquo;s failures.  In The Science of Being Great, you will learn how rushing towards ANY goal can be FATAL to Success.  Yes, taking Massive Action &mdash; when Action is required &mdash; is key to attaining Success on any level; but learning when and where to apply patience is not only virtuous and rewarding, it builds Character, develops Leadership and is Empowering! Life is a process that cannot be hurried and learning to appreciate this simple truth yields results far faster than we might otherwise expect.</p>
<p class="regular">As with most things in life, it is preparation and planning that produces the outcomes that we admire &mdash; whether they be in relationships or other personal matters, corporate achievements or political success stories. The same is true of ourselves and by learning and APPLYING the Scientific Methods of Being Great , you can &mdash; and SHALL &mdash; achieve Extraordinary Greatness &mdash; in YOUR LIFE!</p>
